Just stumbled out of the theater and my brain is like a blender on high without a lid. King of Kings, man, what a ride. Popcorn stuck in my teeth and there was this constant crinkle of wrappers that somehow blended into the soundtrack. Still in a daze. Can't even with that crown scene — you know the one with the crazy lighting that made everything look like it was melting but in a cool way, like Salvador Dali met an iMax screen.

I swear my back's about to just quit on me, those seats should be marked as torture devices. But when Jesus walked on water—was that CGI, or did they actually film Jesus??—I wanted to stand and applaud, but my spine was like nah, buddy. It was so wild, that moment when Judas betrays him felt like betrayal ice cream on a hot day—refreshing but also you're definitely gonna spill it on your shirt.

> The crowd murmurs got louder during the quietest parts, like people batting around their theories on the divine, and isn't it just ironic to download the movie when the big guy himself would probably want you to see it in some dusty old church or something? But for real, can you even download a movie that makes you feel like you're choking on existential dust?

That king in the dream sequence, felt like they zoomed in on the face of time itself. Or maybe it was just the leftover Dots candy stuck rolling under someone's shoe. Was it too long? Felt like a century but not enough at the same time, like trying to live a lifetime during a lunch break. The soundtrack was like, if Beethoven met Bob Dylan at a Subway station and decided to make a beat to the train sounds. 

Watch the movie obviously, but really, are we ever watching? Or is it all just mental movie popcorn—tasty, crunchy, but leaves you hungry for some real plot fiber? 

Random kid in row 7 dropped his soda, sticky sounds punctuating the resurrection part. My soul felt the sticky too, sticking to thoughts like honey does bees.

int main() { 
    whoEvenAmI(); // Was this a dream?
    potato = new Pizza(); 
    return 0;
}
